# Quote-Generator
First ever Python project. Downloaded a dataset at Kaggle which was in JSON-format. Wrote a few functions:

- Fetch a quote by given id
- Fetch a random quote
- List all the unique categories or authors that have a quote in the pack

There were some weird, inappropriate quotes in there that I wanted to delete so I decided to convert the file to an Excel-file to make it easier to find and remove weird content. 
Rewrote all three functions and now the program has the ability to parse JSON aswell as Excel files. Might develop it further in the future, would like to work on:

- Finding a quote by keyword
- Fetching a quote by a certain author
- Fetching a quote from a certain category
- Possibly adding a GUI
